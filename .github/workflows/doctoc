    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2 # is a GitHub Actions community-maintained action that you can use in your workflows to check out your repository's code on the runner machine where the workflow is executed. The @v2 refers to a specific release version of the action (action at version v2). The v2 version tag represents a specific release version of the actions/checkout action. This version is often used. The purpose of this action is to clone or checkout the repository's code into the working directory of the GitHub Actions runner machine.  When GitHub Actions workflows run, they start in a clean environment without the code of your repository. The actions/checkout action ensures that the code is available for the subsequent steps in the workflow.
